/// Sum policy: `baseline + sum(activeSizes)`, optionally capped.
///
/// This is the most common policy for inference workloads. Each ticket adds to
/// the wired limit, making the total proportional to concurrent demand.
///
/// If `cap` is nil, the policy clamps to `GPU.maxRecommendedWorkingSetBytes()`
/// when available. If a cap is provided, both limit computation and admission
/// respect it.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```swift
/// let policy = WiredSumPolicy(cap: 12 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
/// let ticket = policy.ticket(size: kvBytes, kind: .active)
/// try await ticket.withWiredLimit {
///     // run inference
/// }
/// ```

    /// Optional absolute cap (bytes) for the computed limit.
    public let cap: Int?

    /// Creates a sum policy with an optional cap in bytes.
    public init(cap: Int? = nil) {
        self.cap = cap
    }

    /// Computes the desired limit for the current active set.
    public func limit(baseline: Int, activeSizes: [Int]) -> Int {

    public func canAdmit(baseline: Int, activeSizes: [Int], newSize: Int) -> Bool {
        let projected = baseline + activeSizes.reduce(0, +) + max(0, newSize)
        return clamp(projected) == projected
    }

    private func clamp(_ value: Int) -> Int {
        if let cap {
            return min(value, max(0, cap))
        }

            return min(value, maxBytes)
        }
        return value
    }
}

/// Max policy: `max(baseline, max(activeSizes))`.
///
/// This policy tracks the single largest active ticket. It is useful when you
/// want the limit to scale with the largest in-flight request rather than the
/// sum of concurrent work.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```swift
/// let policy = WiredMaxPolicy()
/// let ticket = policy.ticket(size: kvBytes, kind: .active)
/// try await ticket.withWiredLimit {
///     // run inference
/// }
/// ```
public struct WiredMaxPolicy: WiredMemoryPolicy, Hashable, Sendable {
    /// Creates a max policy.
    public init() {}

    }
}

/// Fixed policy: limit is constant while any ticket is active.
///
/// This policy ignores the active sizes and applies a fixed limit any time at
/// least one ticket is active. It is useful when you want a deterministic cap.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```swift
/// let policy = WiredFixedPolicy(limit: 8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
/// let ticket = policy.ticket(size: kvBytes, kind: .active)
/// try await ticket.withWiredLimit {
///     // run inference
/// }
/// ```
public struct WiredFixedPolicy: WiredMemoryPolicy, Hashable, Sendable {
    /// Fixed limit in bytes to apply while any ticket is active.
    public let bytes: Int

    /// Creates a fixed policy with the given limit in bytes.
    public init(limit: Int) {
        self.bytes = limit
